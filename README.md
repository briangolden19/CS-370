# In this project I was provided with the baseline code to run the game, setup the game, and setup the neural network. I had to create the code for the Q-Training Method. This was done by using some pseudocode as a reference but otherwise just trying to figure it out myself.
# Computer scientists can do research into what it means to teach a machine how to "be". By learning about neural networks and how to make them learn in a more general way, we can make innovations in other fields and help come up with new methods of doing just about anything.
# I approach issues as a computer scientist by trying to find the most efficient way to break something down into steps and easily managed modules or methods. By trying to break an issue into smaller parts I can easily understand how each part of the bigger program works and can maintain them easier. 
# My ethical responsibility to the end user and an organization is to make sure I am not adding anything malicious into the code I write. I should also make sure to be transparent about the data I am collecting and how I am handling the data I do save. I will also make sure that I am securing all of the data and communications that I keep as a way to make sure everyone is protected.
